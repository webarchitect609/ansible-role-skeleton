Ansible Role: Role Name
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webarchitect609/{{ role_name }}.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webarchitect609/{{ role_name }})

// A brief description of the role goes here.
Installs the application.

Requirements
------------

// Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the role should be mentioned here. For instance, if
// the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

None.

Role Variables
--------------

// A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in
// defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables
// that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as
// well.

None of the variables need to be altered for installing the latest stable version of the application. 
However, all available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    variable: default-value
    
Variable description.

Dependencies
------------

// A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be
// set for other roles, or variables that are used from other roles.

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

// Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice
// for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
      // TODO Use role name from the galaxy here.
         - { role: webarchitect609.role_name }
